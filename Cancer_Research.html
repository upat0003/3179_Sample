          <h2>History of Cancer Disease </h2>
          <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world after cardiovascular diseases. Cancer develops when normal cells in a particular part of the body begin to grow out of control. There are different types of
cancers; all types of cancer cells continue to grow, divide and re-divide instead of dying and form new abnormal cells. Some types of cancer cells often travel to other parts of the body through blood circulation or lymph vessels (metastasis), where
they begin to grow. Half of men and one third of women in the world will develop cancer during their lifetimes. Today, millions of cancer people extend their life due to early
identification and treatment. Cancer is not a new disease and has afflicted people throughout the world.
               In the next graph, the estimates of the patients infected to cancer disease (per population of 100 people) is shown by each country in 2017, which helps us understand how rapidly the disease is evolving in certain countries. As graph 
              represents, the African countries have very high number of patients in 2017.

            <p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified that “Drinking alcohol raises your risk of getting cancer disease”. It is further stated that All types of alcoholic drinks are linked with cancer. The more you drink, the higher your cancer risk. As far as it is concerned, there are number of countries all over the world which have been found to have this data being correlated. The chart beside shows the percentage of patients ended up losing their lives due to infection by Cancer disease and Alcohol consumption. United Kingdom seemingly has the most death rate by cancer as compared to any other countries in 2017; while Zimbabwe has the lowest death rate of same for the year.</p>

          <p>Likewise, Research has found several risk factors that may increase your chances of getting disease especially lung cancer. Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States, cigarette smoking is linked to about 80% to 90% of lung cancer deaths
People who smoke cigarettes are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke. Even smoking a few cigarettes, a day or smoking occasionally increases the risk of lung cancer. The more years a person smokes and the more cigarettes smoked each day; the more risk goes up.</p>

          <p>Whether women are more or equally susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoke on the lungs compared with men is a matter of controversy. Using a large French population-based case–control study, we compared the lung cancer risk associated with cigarette smoking by gender. The study suggests: “The lung cancer risk was similar among men and women. However, we found that women had a two-fold greater risk associated with a one-unit increase in CSI than men of developing either small cell carcinoma. Hence, heavy smoking might confer to women a higher risk of lung cancer as compared with men”</p>

          <p>To identify the relationship of cancer with Alcohol and Smoking, the smoking rate for the above ten countries have been plotted in the next graphs. These graphs tell well for gender wise comparison as each country have fair amount of smoking rate involved in 2017. The smoking rate in female is less than male in all these countries but Australia, US, UK and Switzerland are found to be having similar rate for both gender which will lead to interesting results further as it intrudes lung cancer disease. 

By comparison, Zimbabwe has vast difference of smoking rate as the rate in male is 20.5% compared to 1.3% in female. China too has huge difference between the smoking rate of both gender (2% for female vs 44.8% for male).</p>

            <p>The map here shows the lung cancer numbers in female around the world and it meets the relationship for certain countries. As found in previous graph, female in India having low smoke rate is one of the reasons India’s numbers are very low overall for female losing their lives due to lung cancer. On the other side, United Stated and Australia have relatively high numbers which says the smoking rate has something to do with lung cancer disease, especially in females.</p>

        <p>The other dangerous type of cancer is Melanoma skin cancer. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes (the cells that give the skin its tan or brown color) start to grow out of control. Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer and can then spread to other areas of the body. 
Melanoma is much less common than some other types of skin cancers. But melanoma is more dangerous because it is much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.

            <p>Here, the Melanoma cancer rate is shown for countries like Australia, US, UK, Switzerland, and India. It can be seen that the four countries containing large cancer infection numbers does have the bigger contribution to overall Melanoma cancer data. However, India has less than 1% patients suffering from Melanoma cancer. That means, the larger countries with high amount of cancer rate needs to diagnose the disease which has been in the making.</p>

            <p>Finally, the countries with higher infection rate have vast number of survival rate. However, countries in Africa are the exception where they lose more lives than any other countries.
Radiology technologies have been in effect in recent years which has made it possible for medical field to cure disease. However, it has not been possible for every country (especially developing countries) to fight their war against cancer.

          <p>In conclusion: Cancer, as a disease, develops due to various factors. Apart from genetic predisposition,  the lifestyle of individual plays a major role in the development of different cancers. As shown above, there are direct correlations between smoking, alcohol consumption, and cancer.
However, in more developed countries,  Radiotherapy and chemotherapy (data not shown) are far more advanced. This leads to better survival rates in these countries.</p>
